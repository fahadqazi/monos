Notes:

Developed using Java's Slick 2D and LWJGL libraries but controlled from JRuby, a JVM based Ruby implementation. Runs very much like any other Java app though.

In Bodge's Island you're a rich game developer looking for some peace on your new private island. But fanboys are on the way! If they reach you, your spirit will be sapped so find a way to remain alone.
