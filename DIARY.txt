The code is like a very messy car wreck. But I've been learning
a lot. Picking up Slick which dealing with all the Java integration

Have a basic build on Windows now. Going to forget about Windows

on Windows properly. I wanted to have the Slick and LWJGL stuff in
vendor but once packaged up, Windows is not playing ball. So into
lib/ they go!
