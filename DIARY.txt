Got the concept of game 'states' involved. So there's now an
'intro' screen (with nothing on it!) and a gameplay state you
can enter (using Space).

The plan now is to come up with a very basic game mechanism on
top of the tiling idea so far so that I have a chance of 
completing something playable.

Due to family commitments, I am only now able to get back on the 
case again :-) I'll probably get about 12 hours of development
time in all, rather than 48, as I'm taking my daughter to see
"Santa" tomorrow!

We now have smooth movement of a non-character around a rather
non-level. Time to think of an actual idea and a "game" around
some of this stuff now. Hmm.

Quite a lot of progress in the last 30 minutes. Started doing some
structuring and breaking things out into classes. Pushed rendering
off to specific classes. Introduced a 'character' of sorts and you
can now walk around a map. No game mechanic yet but there's something
to "do".

06:24
Some relatively smooth scrolling at least. Started to get tired so
will have a little think about an actual game idea, fiddle with
some sounds, and get ready to head home.

06:05
The code is like a very messy car wreck. But I've been learning
a lot. Picking up Slick which dealing with all the Java integration
and performance issues is proving the time suck. I'll need to
come up with a very simple game so I have a chance of finishing :-)

04:39
Hmm, it's using 200MB extra memory every second. That's not good.

04:01
Have learnt how to get scaled, pixelated graphics on a Java
graphics context. That took longer than expected. Now let's look
at some structure to all this..

Let's get this baby on GitHub!

02:55
Have a basic build on Windows now. Going to forget about Windows
for quite some time and get on to actual work ;-)

02:51
For some reason I've wasted a lot of time getting the build to run 
on Windows properly. I wanted to have the Slick and LWJGL stuff in
vendor but once packaged up, Windows is not playing ball. So into
lib/ they go!
